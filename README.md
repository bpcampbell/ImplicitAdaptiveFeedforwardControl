# ImplicitAdaptiveFeedforwardControl
Implicit adaptive feedforward control. An adaptive feedforward controller that does not require a model of the system, provide an input, an error, and connect the output. The system will learn how to adapt the output (based on the input) to reduce the error.

Open and run the initialise_sim.m file. This will load the simulation parameters into the workspace. Then run the simulink file and view the signals with the scopes!
